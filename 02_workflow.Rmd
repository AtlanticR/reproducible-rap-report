# WORKFLOW

## Brief overview
This technical report represents an overview of the processes employed in the Spatial Reproducible Reporting Tool, and each main box presented is described in a separate section (Fig. \@ref(fig:rap-workflow)). This work was motivated by repeat requests for reports that identified relevant datasets, which previously took several weeks to prepare. In response, this data discovery tool was developed to generate automated Reports to identify relevant DFO and non-DFO datasets within a user-defined area in the DFO Maritimes region. The resulting output is an HTML document outlining datasets, caveats, sources of uncertainty, and contacts to the relevant parties.

```

## Collaboration
The development of this tool has been advanced and made possible by a core team of Strategic RAP Champions in close collaboration with various species experts, data providers, technicians, programmers, managers, and more, both within and external to DFO. Ultimately, the value of this tool is predicated on expert consultation and co-creation, and the input from these parties have been integral to the ideation and development process of this tool. For example, the end-users are involved to ensure the product is representative of their needs, and each section of the Report displays and summarizes the data in a way that is useful for decision-making. Data providers and species experts have helped guide the creation of written descriptions, data visualizations, and documentation of the caveats and disclaimers of each dataset. Data collection can be challenging, difficult, expensive, and is often fit for a specific purpose; therefore, highlighting this information was essential to prevent misinterpretation or incorrect use of the data. As our work evolves and new funding streams are pursued, co-creation also ensures we continue to communicate with the relevant parties to verify that the goals and future ambitions remain reasonable and feasible with the information we are collecting, mining, and reporting. 

## System
We used R [@RCoreTeam2021] as the main programming language for data preparation, pre-processing, coding, and visualization. Specifically, we leveraged the Shiny Application (App) [@Chang2021] to create a user interface to define the search area and generate the Reproducible Reports using R Markdown [@Xie2018]. To avoid issues with R package updates and to ensure the versions were similar between all users, we used the dependency manager *renv* [@Ushey2022renv].

R was selected for the data pre-processing, user interface, and report generation because it is free, open-source, and is highly popular in biology [@Jia2022; @Lai2019; @Wright2019], oceanography [@Kelley2018; @Malde2020], and spatial data analysis [@Kaya2019]. R is widely-adopted within DFO [@Choi2018; @Edwards2018; @Gomez2020; @Gomez2021], and its use presented an opportunity to maximize interoperability with tools, packages and workflows being developed by DFO Science [e.g., @Ricard2013; @Anderson2022; @Regular2020]. In addition, R has a large online help community, with multiple specialized packages to improve workflow [@Boettiger2015; @Tippmann2015], and is frequently used in projects aiming to increase reproducibility in workflows and report creation [@Lowndes2017; @Xie2017; @Xie2018]. Selecting R as a universal language for the tool also reduces the cognitive overhead for a small team and minimizes the technical knowledge required for collaboration. The modular workflows employed ensure that additional languages and tools can be incorporated with minimal overhead (e.g., replacing R Shiny with another user interface or using Python for data pre-processing of a particular data type) of the tool. In the future, R packages such as *reticulate* [@Ushey2022reticulate] could be used to insert segments of Python code into R Markdown documents. In addition, Quarto [@Quarto2022], the next generation of R Markdown, could be used to render Reports. Quarto incorporates a variety of other languages (i.e., R, Python, Julia, Observable JS), all while maintaining the literate programming advantages offered by R Markdown [@Knuth1984; @Xie2018]. The strength of this work is not linked to its current emphasis on R, but rather based on the fundamentals of reproducibility and ease of collaboration among peers.

We also use Git [-@Git2022] and GitHub [-@GitHub2022] for version control. Git allows changes in plain text files (e.g., .R, .RData, or .Rmd file extensions containing the code), to be tracked and identified on a single computer, and GitHub is a web-based platforms to host the Git-tracked code online, and allow collaborative workflows with multiple team members [@Blischak2016; @Git2022; @GitHub2022; @Perez-Riverol2016]. These tools are especially well-suited for team projects, since members can make additions to, or experiment with, the code without affecting the original project, and then merge it into the original workflow if it is deemed suitable [@Blischak2016; @Perez-Riverol2016]. Following these approaches, we can track our code with Git and revert back to previous versions if needed. Our code is made publicly available on GitHub (<https://github.com/dfo-mar-odis/shinySpatialApp>); however, due to issues related to Protected B information, the data are not publicly accessible. As a result, currently, only core members of our team at DFO can generate the Reports in response to requests for information. The core team is not, and should not, be perceived as data providers or data custodians. 

## Species focus
Aquatic species (i.e., marine mammals, fish, reptiles, and mollusks) that have been listed under the Species at Risk Act [@SARA2002] or are under consideration for listing (i.e., assessed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, COSEWIC) are the current focus of this Reproducible Reporting framework. However, recognizing the importance of ecosystem-based approaches for management, this Report also includes information on ecosystem components (e.g., intertidal vegetation and habitat), and areas designated for spatial planning (e.g., Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas). In addition, users of the Report have requested several additional species to be included due to their specific reporting needs.

## Inputs
### Data sources
Data are compiled and used by our core team in multiple different formats including both vector (i.e., points, lines, polygons) and raster (i.e., gridded/cell-based) datasets. Although this work typically focuses on species presence (i.e., point data), several datasets are obtained from trawl surveys (i.e., line data) and habitat information (i.e., polygon data). Derived data products or species predictions are often in polygon or raster format. 

Data gathered from multiple DFO and non-DFO sources are available in a variety of forms, and we have adapted our workflows to accommodate these various data types. This has included but is not limited to:

* R packages [e.g., the *robis* R package for accessing the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) data, @Provoost2021];
* URL links to the data [e.g., the Government of Canada Open Data portal, @OpenData2022]; and
* Emailed data files (e.g., csv files).

We track the datasets that have been or will be incorporated into the Report in an Excel spreadsheet on SharePoint, and use this to state approximate timelines for completion, and to monitor which team member is responsible for the addition of each new dataset or section. This spreadsheet is continually updated as we progress, or as we are made aware of additional datasets that may be useful for the Report. 

### Data storage and updates
New data or changes to datasets can bring challenges to our Reports, if the code is not adapted to deal with potential issues such as new data formats or outliers. As a result, we do not host “live” versions of the data, and instead versions of the data are downloaded and stored on internal servers. However, for Open Data records, automated GitHub actions were developed to periodically run tests and update the Open Data files. Copies of the processed data, metadata, and final Reports are maintained on DFO’s internal network. We intend to move all datasets to the Azure cloud system once it can host Protected B information. 

### Data access
These datasets have different Government of Canada security levels, which affect how we store and distribute the data. For each dataset, we identify its security level from the following classifications:

* None: data do not present any security risks or include sensitive government information and assets; and
* Protected B: Data may include information or assets that, if compromised, could cause serious injury to an individual, organization or government [@PWGSC2021].  

The above classifications are then used to guide data use constraints, which specify how the data can be used by individuals. These include:

* None: data can be used and freely shared by anyone. This is typical of data that are made publicly available such as through the Canada Open Data Portal [@OpenData2022], or other online portals such as OBIS [-@OBIS2022] and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility [-@GBIF2022].
* DFO Internal Use Only: data are not to be shared externally to DFO. This is true for all Protected B data, and some DFO datasets that are not shared publicly. 

Because the Reports contain Protected B data, we treat each Report as Protected B, and they are not to be shared outside of DFO. We are currently considering approaches to create Reports that do not contain Protected B data, so they can be freely-shared with the public or other government departments or agencies.

### Quality tiers
Tiers of data quality for each dataset were developed by our team and the data providers in order to provide guidance and urge caution when interpreting the data summaries (Table \@ref(tab:qualTable)). Considerable subjectivity remains in this classification; we welcome suggestions about how to improve this section to characterize information from a vast variety of sources. 

```{r qualTable, results = "asis"}
qualData <- readr::read_csv(file.path("data", "QualityTiers.csv"))
options(knitr.kable.NA = "") # include this or blank rows from linesep function will show NA

csasdown::csas_table(qualData,
  #col.names = c("Year", as.character(ages)),
  caption = "Quality tiers defined to describe sources of information queried and summarized in this Report.",
  format = "latex", 
  linesep = "") %>% # add a blank line between the row entries
  #font_size = 8) %>%
  kableExtra::column_spec(1, width = "5em") %>%
  kableExtra::column_spec(2, width = "15em") %>%
  kableExtra::column_spec(3, width = "15em")
```

### Writing descriptions
Written descriptions of each dataset are included with the data search outputs. Topics include an overview of the sampling strategy, survey locations, sampling year, sources of uncertainty, and references to the literature. For records from Open Data, we use the dataset description directly from the Open Data record. For all other records, dataset descriptions are created in collaboration with the experts to ensure the descriptions are correctly conveyed and communicated. Notably, the identification of any caveats and disclaimers is fundamental to our work to ensure the data is not misinterpreted or misused beyond its original intention. 

In addition to disclaimers associated with each specific dataset, there are several disclaimers described below that are reflective of the entire Report including:

* This document is a tool to support, not to replace, Science advice and peer-review processes.
* This Report does not endeavor to describe every source of information available; the data presented does not represent all available data within the search area and additional information may be available from other sources, or more recent data may be available than what is presented here.
* This Report is not intended to provide the data itself, but to summarize what is available. Users are encouraged to:
  + Access the original data source if more information is required;
  + Circulate this document to all contacts outlined in the different sections of the Report for each data source, to ensure the veracity of inference drawn from the Report, and to provide any supplemental information that may support the provision of science advice.
* The focus of this Report is on available observations of species presence and not on absences, quantities (e.g., species abundance or biomass), frequency, or catch information.
* The absence of a species in this Report should be interpreted as an absence of observation or reporting of the species, not necessarily as a true absence of the species.
* Unless otherwise specified, data were queried from 2010 to present. This was selected as an arbitrary time range to present the most recent information. Please contact data providers if data outside of these ranges are required.
* Current outputs of species observations in the Report aggregate all years in summary plots and tables (i.e., 2010 to present). Annual summaries are not displayed. If you require annual summaries or other information beyond species presence, please contact relevant data providers/custodians for each data source.
* All maps in this Report are for informational purposes and are not suitable for legal or surveying purposes. Maps represent only the approximate location of boundaries.
* This Report is intended for internal DFO use only. Privacy screening [i.e., the rule of 5, see @DFO2020] is not yet integrated into all data products and summaries generated by the Report.
Outputs of this Report are not suitable for real-time, dynamic spatial planning.
* Because coastal areas of the Scotian Shelf bioregion are generally not adequately sampled to characterize fine-scale ecological characteristics (i.e., species, habitat composition and variability within a sub-regional focal area), the distribution of (some) species featured within the Report, when the search area is near to the coast, should be used as a first-order estimate limited by the spatial-temporal resolution of available data.

### User-defined search area
The search area is determined by the Report user and often reflects dispersal of a substance such as Predicted Exposure Zones for aquaculture [@DFO2021] or the estimated area of dispersal from an oil spill. These search areas are provided to the Shiny App in several different ways including (Fig. \@ref(fig:shiny-AOI)):

* Draw from map: user can interactively draw a user-defined search area on the map in various formats including polygon, rectangle or circle; 
* Bounding box: user provides minimum and maximum latitude and longitude coordinates;
* Individual point: user provides coordinates for a single location. In addition, a buffer, in meters, is typically also provided to search for data within a larger area; and
* Upload from file: user can upload a spatial data file. This tool supports a variety of vector formats (e.g., ESRI shapefiles, KMLs, etc.)

```{r shiny-AOI, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Screenshot of the R Shiny Application developed to draw an area of interest in various formats (draw from map, bounding box, individual point, or import files). Currently, only members of the core team are able to generate Reports due security concerns associated with Protected B information.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("data/shinyAOI.png"))
```

Typically, these Reports are generated to search for data within a single user-defined search area. However, the tool is flexible enough to allow a search for data within several areas. In these instances, the data within all areas are combined in the search outputs. If the data for each user-defined search area needs to be separated, different Reports could be created (e.g., one user-defined search area per report, or one report summarizing different components of multiple areas).

## Procedures

### Preprocessing
The provided datasets are subject to various preprocessing procedures to standardize the data files and ensure consistency between data objects before they are loaded into the R Markdown files. Each dataset is assigned dedicated preprocessing procedures, written as an R script, and includes (where applicable):

* Filtering years from 2010 until present (we exclude data prior to this date);
* Splitting the data (if necessary) for entry into the different sections of the Report using a spreadsheet list to assign them into these classes;
* Selecting required fields or columns and renaming columns to standardized headers (e.g., year, scientific name, species name, COSEWIC status, SARA status, latitude, longitude, etc.);
* Converting the spatial data into either a common data format. For most cases, standardized simple feature (*sf*) objects are used (explained more below), with raster data being converted into *raster* objects. 
* Transforming any reference system to a common standard (EPSG  4326);
* Clipping spatial data to the extent of the region; and
* Attaching the associated metadata.

The final output of the preprocessing steps is a named list with a format referred to as a Reproducible Reporting (*RR*) object which is saved into a .RData file. 

### Metadata
We refer to “metadata” as the information listed at the beginning of each dataset in the search outputs of the Report. These entries were determined by our team to include several key attributes of the datasets that Report users should be aware of. The metadata is stored within the *RR* objects created in preprocessing. Metadata entries include:

* Title: dataset title used in the report.
* Contact: name and email address of relevant contact for the dataset.
* URL: dataset URL to provide more information about the data. 
* Last retrieved on: the date when the data were retrieved from the data provider or when the data provider sent us the data.
* Search years: the years of data collection. This is typically from 2010 until present, or as much as the dataset covers. Note that more data can be provided if needed, but this was selected as an arbitrary time range to present the most recent information relevant for Aquaculture Siting and Environmental Response. 
* Security level: options are None or Protected B. Refer to the “Input data” section for a more detailed description of each option.
* Data use constraints: used to define how the data are allowed to be shared. Options are None or DFO Internal Use Only. Refer to the “Input data” section for a more detailed description of each option.
* Quality tier: options are High, Medium, or Low. Refer to the “Input data” section for a more detailed description of each option.

### *RR* objects
The *RR* objects are created as a result of the preprocessing steps described above. These standardized objects are used as data inputs for a variety of common functions to develop the dynamic aspects of the Report (e.g., metadata, tables and maps). The spatial data in the *RR* objects are stored as simple feature (*sf*) objects, a formal standard for storing spatial data [ISO 19125-1:2004, @Pebesma2018]. *Sf* objects store both species information (e.g., common name, scientific name, SARA status, COSEWIC status, etc.) and a geometry column that contains the spatial information of the data. The most common geometries include point, linestring (i.e., line), and polygon, although others are available [@Pebesma2018]. *Sf* objects also include a coordinate reference system which describes how to place the data on the Earth’s surface (in this case, EPSG 4326). Although *sf* objects could readily be exported as an ESRI shapefile or, more appropriately, another open data format (e.g., GeoJSON), saving these as .RData minimizes the read and write times, and prevents various formatting issues (e.g., ESRI shapefile field name character limits).

### *RR* functions
Once in the *RR* format, custom functions were developed to further manipulate these data for visualization and search purposes. This includes listing the metadata, partitioning the data based on various spatial extents, and displaying the data in tabular (or other) format. These functions are then used in the R Markdown scripts to generate the Reports. The use of *RR* objects allows common functions to apply to most datasets, which reduces both coding effort associated with new datasets, and the total quantity and complexity of code. These functions increase the output quality by ensuring that figures, tables, and sections have a common formatting. Where output tables are necessary, functions were created to produce standardized tables of the search results. Typically, the total number of records of a Species at Risk located within the user-defined search area and search period (2010 to present) are tabulated, although based on sampling methods, sometimes only species presence is shown. Other information, such as the species’ COSEWIC and SARA statuses, are also included.

### R Markdown
We used R Markdown to generate the final Reports. Each dataset within the Report contains an R Markdown file (extension .Rmd) which can be loaded into the main report as an R Markdown Child. Static information is written directly into the files and includes information such as the dataset descriptions, disclaimers, and caveats. The formatting of this text is also specified so features such as the headings and typographic emphasis (e.g., underline, bold, italics) are consistent. The dynamic information is called using the functions described above to display information such as the metadata, tables, references, and maps. In our case, the final document is rendered as an HTML file, although other formats are possible including PDFs or Microsoft Word Documents [@Xie2018].

### Shiny App
Built by inSileco (https://www.insileco.io/), the Shiny App supports the users in the process of interactively identifying a search area, and liaises with the R Markdown documents to generate the Reports. Because the code is fully open and available on GitHub, edits to the App can be made by the team at DFO without needing to contact the external contractors at inSileco. Due to security concerns associated with Protected B information, currently only the core team of this project are able to generate Reports.

The Shiny App, or Spatial Reproducible Reporting Tool, has various tabs on the left-hand side, with a Leaflet map display [@Graul2016] on the right to show spatial context and define the user’s search area (Fig. \@ref(fig:shiny-Sections)). First, the user must enter their contact information and accept the Terms and Conditions of the Report (Fig. \@ref(fig:shiny-Sections)A). Next, the geometry of the search area is defined, either by directly drawing on the map, importing a spatial file, or coding numerically into the applicable box (Fig. \@ref(fig:shiny-Sections)B). These geometries are then validated to ensure topological consistencies, such as non-overlapping search areas or that the polygons are closed (Fig. \@ref(fig:shiny-Sections)B). The user can either generate a Full Report and select the relevant sections to be included (Fig. \@ref(fig:shiny-Sections)C), or generate a Custom Report which has fixed content for each end-user application (Fig \@ref(fig:shiny-Sections)D). The process for generating Custom Reports (Fig. \@ref(fig:shiny-Sections)D) is still in development. When specifying either Report type, the user can also define the filename, and select the language (English or French) to be used.

```{r shiny-Sections, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Overview of the R Shiny Application that allows users to (A) state their contact information and accept the Terms and Conditions, and (B) enter their region of interest and ensure these geometries are valid (e.g., polygons are closed). The user then either (C) generates a Full Report and selects the relevant modules to be included, or (D) creates a Custom Report that is tailored for various applications. Currently, only members of the core team are able to generate Reports due security concerns associated with Protected B information.", echo=FALSE, fig.pos='H'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("data/shinyAppSections.png"))
```

### Output
The final HTML document takes approximately four minutes to generate. The Report has various sections and is constantly being adapted as new datasets are added, or as the goals and objectives of this work expand. This section describes the outputs for Full Reports (Fig. \@ref(fig:shiny-Sections)C), rather than Custom Reports (Fig. \@ref(fig:shiny-Sections)D), which are still in development. Currently, these sections are as follows:

1. **Background information**

    This section includes a multi-paragraph description of the Report including an overview of the intent of the document, the system (i.e., the programming behind the Report), disclaimers for Report use, data access, and quality tiers. 

2. **Search results**

    Within this section, the available data within the user’s search area are presented. If no data for a specific dataset are observed, an automatically-generated message will appear stating this. When data are present, typically both a map depicting the data observations, and a table with a data summary are presented. For point data, tables usually document the number of occurrences for each species within the search area. For polygon data (e.g., Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas), tables typically state which regions intersect with the search area, although this may vary depending on the dataset. Currently, datasets are presented within three main modules, including: 
    
    i. **Species**: Results are currently categorized into (a) Information from the National Aquatic Species at Risk Geotabase, (b) Fish and Invertebrates, (c) Cetaceans, and (d) Areas designated for spatial planning (Fig. \@ref(fig:shiny-Sections)C). We recognize these are not perfect divisions, but were selected as a method for grouping similar datasets and were primarily based on our users’ needs. Datasets with information in more than one of these listed modules may be listed more than once. For example, data from OBIS and GBIF contain both “Fish and Invertebrate” (b) and “Cetacean” (c), and data from these portals are separated and summarized within each submodule.
    ii. **Context**: Provides information on species habitat such as rockweed presence/absence, and EBSAs.
    iii. **Human Threats**: This section is currently under development and primarily focuses on data products of human activities (i.e., Fishing, Shipping, Miscellaneous, and Cumulative Impact Mapping; Fig. \@ref(fig:shiny-Sections)C) within the search area. This section also contains summary tables (under the Miscellaneous submodule; Fig \@ref(fig:shiny-Sections)C) which show whether or not a species was present in any of the available datasets, and which datasets they were observed in. A literature review of threats and threat mitigation for Species at Risk is also provided. 
Because users can interactively select the modules and submodules to be included from the Shiny App, not all sections and subsections may be included in the Full Reports (Fig. \@ref(fig:shiny-Sections)C). 

3. **Contributors**

    This section lists and recognizes the contributions from the approximately sixty individuals who have provided data, context, and ideas for the Reproducible Reporting initiative.

4. **References**
    
    Here, the citations for references and datasets that were included in the Report are presented. Citation information was stored in BibTeX format and called in the R Markdown documents.

### Community engagement
As Strategic RAP Champions, we aim to bring reproducible workflows to the forefront within DFO. We have led multiple engagement sessions to bridge siloed units, which has involved broad discussions and topics such as making data more available, and challenges associated with data security, storage and upgrades. Procedures developed as part of this project support national efforts to encourage Open Data publication, and ensure consistency and quality control of Open Data products, by providing validation and feedback to fix any errors that may be detected. For example, an error was detected and reported for the newly-incorporated Passamaquoddy Open Data record [@DFO2022_PBBT]. We have also used our work as an opportunity to move data holders from outdated storage approaches to managed solutions, and in many cases, this work has served as an opportunity for data rescue. The means of communicating our work and messages have varied over time. The networking capacity in the department at a national level dramatically increased in the past years with the mobilization of the workforce to the Microsoft Teams platform, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This shared virtual platform has provided a unique opportunity to collaborate and deliver this project via formal and informal meetings, discussions, presentations, and chats.

The following includes specific examples where we have actively contributed and shared knowledge related to our work:

* We have coordinated and participated in activities related to the R Learning & Development community to improve approaches, share lessons learned, and transfer reproducibility skills to the broader community. For example, this has included a series of five presentations and focused break-out groups presented by inSileco to introduce interested members of DFO to Git, GitHub, R Markdown, and *csasdown*. 
* Multiple presentations and discussions (30+) have been held for the past three years with various sectors (e.g., Science, Aquaculture Management, Marine Planning and Conservation, Integrated Planning, and the Species at Risk Program), including a DFO Maritimes Coffee Chat, a Fed Talk, and an hour-long presentation to the Population Ecology Division as well as the National R Learning & Development community at DFO. 
* We led a two-day hackathon in February 2022 with members of the Ocean Tracking Network and DFO-Maurice Lamontagne Institute (MLI). The DFO-MLI team is interested in using reproducible reporting tools to generate general outputs from their annual at-sea missions.
